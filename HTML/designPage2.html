                        As seen in the screenshot above, the home section remained the same from the previous submission. The only changes made to this section was the responsiveness. The font- size decreases as the screen width decreases. Furthermore, in extreme cases (tiny screen width), I took out the statement <q> I am passionate about digital design</q>. This saves room for my name which is the main content that I want to display on the home section. The shade of blue used is consistent throughout the home section. This shade of blue was chosen to match the colours in the background image. Further reasons for selecting blue can be found in my first reflection. Lastly, I added an indication on the side bar to tell the user which section they are currently viewing (seen in the navigation bar). This was done to give the user clarification on section navigation [1]. Furthermore, the indication bar matches the colour scheme which unifies the user-experience.

                    The first noticeable change is the background image. In order to optimize the performance of my website, I decided to use a single static background image for the entire page instead of having different images for each section. Furthermore, I used TinyJpeg.com[2] to reduce the size of the background image. I also optimized all my other images using the same software. The combination of these two changes optimized my website loading time. The second change is the Download CV button. When the user clicks this button, my CV opens up immediately in a new tab. This decision was made so that the user can view my CV without having to download it first. In my opinion this creates a streamlined user-experience because it reduces any downloading delays.

                <h3><span>Blog </span>Section:</h3>

                <img id="SG"  src="../Images/Screenshot (359).jpg" alt="Wireframe for blog section" >

                <article>
                    The blog section does not have many changes. The first change was a technical change. Instead of using the &#60 br &#62 tags for spacing , I used CSS padding. As seen in the screenshot above, the side-bar navigation shows the user that they are on the blog section. It can also be seen that the user is hovering over the blog 1 abstract. The background of the blog text box changes to blue. This blue is the same shade of blue that is used throughout the website. Once again this unifies the colour scheme and gives the user a consistent user-experience. The other changes occur within the actual blog pages. The side-bar navigation remains in place even when the user clicks to view a blog. This gives the user an option to navigate to any desired section of the website. The last addition that was added within the blog pages was the ‘Previous Blog’ and ‘Next Blog’ buttons. This streamlined the user-experience because the user did not need to traverse between the blog abstracts and the blog pages to see the previous or next blog. Lastly, when the user hovers over these buttons, they turn blue to unify the colour scheme further.

                <h3><span>Experience </span>Section:</h3>

                <img id="SG"  src="../Images/Screenshot (360).jpg" alt="Wireframe for experience section" >

                <article>
                    The first change in the experience section was populating the text with my relevant experience. It is not complete yet, but the rest will be done for the exam submission. I then added a border around each block of text. This was done to separate the information visually which made it easier to read. Furthermore, the border colour matches the shade of blue used throughout the website. This further unifies the colour scheme. I also fixed the responsiveness for this section. The font-size decreases as the screen width decreases. The horizontal bars indicating my coding experience also decreases in width. This results in an experience section that is responsive to any screen size.

                <h3><span>Portfolio </span>Section:</h3>

                <img id="SG"  src="../Images/Screenshot (362).jpg" alt="Wireframe for portfolio section" >
                <article>
                    The first change to the portfolio section was the abstract layout. It was decided to use a consistent layout that matches the blog section abstracts. This was done be replicating the colour slide effect from the blog section. As seen in the screenshot above, the user is hovering over portfolio abstract 1. The background is highlighted in blue to allow for easy reading and to indicate that the abstract can be clicked. The next addition was populating the portfolio section with my unity projects. I completed 5 out of the 6 portfolio projects. There will be further additions and more elaborate descriptions in the exam submission. Once the user clicks a portfolio abstract , the website navigates to the portfolio page. The portfolio page consists of a screenshot of gameplay and a description under it. Furthermore, JavaScript was used to create a particle effect background for the portfolio pages. This effect further illustrates my passion for digital design which is why it was included. The particles are also the same shade of blue used in the entire website. This further unifies this user-experience. I then uploaded my games to itch.io[3] and provided a ‘Play Game’ button. When the user clicks this button, they get directed to my game on the itch.io website. I also added a ‘Next Project’  button to make the navigation to the next project easier for the user. The styling of these buttons are exactly the same as in the blog pages. This creates a unified user-experience and meets the expectations built up by the user.

                <h3><span>Design </span>Section:</h3>

                <img id="SG"  src="../Images/Screenshot (363).jpg" alt="Wireframe for design section" >

                <article>
                    The design section responsiveness was an issue in the first submission. As a result I fixed these issues by reducing the font sizes and flex direction of the container. Furthermore, I reduced the size of the design page hyperlink image. This optimized the loading time of my website. I also removed the background image within my design page. This was done due to a slow loading time. I needed to have my wireframe images and style guide screenshots all on the same page so the best solution for the second submission was to remove the background image. In order to keep the unified feel to the page, I added a blue borders around my screenshots (not the wireframes). I also added the static navigation bar which remains consistent throughout my website. Other than responsiveness, the navigation bar and optimization, the design section remained the same with the exception of my second submission reflection.

                    The contact section remained relatively the same for the second submission. The only change was fixing the responsiveness. This was done by implementing a flex display and changing the flex direction to column in CSS.

                <h3><span>Technical </span>Refelection:</h3>
                <article>
                    My second submission includes improvements in semantic markup. For example I used the &#60cite&#62 tags for my references, the &#60article&#62 tags for my blogs and I made better use of ranking my headings with the &#60h&#62 tags. It is important to note that I did not edit my first 3 blogs. This will be edited for the final exam submission. I also added some microformats. For example I used rel=”author” in my blog posts to indicate that I am the author. In terms of JavaScript there can be certain improvements. I added the aesthetic on the navigation bar (to indicate which section is active) using JavaScript. I also implemented the background for the portfolio pages using JavaScript. These scripts will need to be optimized further for the exam submission. Further JavaScript will be implemented for navigation purpose.
